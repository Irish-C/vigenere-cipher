# vigenere-cipher
This repository contains encryption tool. This tool uses vigenere cipher with user-defined keys. This repository is intended for academic purposes only and should not be used for any malicious activities.

# How the code works
It will accept a string as encrypted text and then the program will decrypt it using the following character substitute:

**'a' = *, 'e' = & , 'i' = # , 'o' = + 'u' = !**

See sample output:
Enter a string to decrypt: th& q!#ck br+wn f+x j!mps +v&r th& l*zy d+g. The Plain Text: the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
